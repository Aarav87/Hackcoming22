## Description

As winter approaches, so does the season of flu and sickness, which prevents people from enjoying the holiday season. Illnesses during this season make many people feel tired and lethargic instead of the joy that they should feel in the holidays! With staff shortages in hospitals and new types of illnesses, people don't know what illness they have, and as a result, they aren't able to treat it. To solve this, I created a machine learning website that diagnoses your sickness based on symptoms.

The website takes in up to 132 symptoms from the user, and uses machine learning to diagnose the illness from 42 possible options. It also tells the user the actions that they should take to recover from their illness.
